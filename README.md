### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Daniele Napolitano, and currently I'm studying computer engineering at the university of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Dipartimento di Ingegneria Enzo Ferrari, Unimore). <br>

###  What I'm currently working on ðŸ”­
I'm developing my thesis project for my bachelor degree in Computer Engineering. <br>
It's about Augmented reality and IoT (using the CoAP protocol), so there are other smaller repos on similar subjects that I've made to learn the basics.
