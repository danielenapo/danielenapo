###  What I'm currently working on ðŸ”­
I'm developing my thesis project for my bachelor degree in Computer Engineering. 
It's still work in progress, but you can look at [this repository](https://github.com/danielenapo/tesi).
The project is about Augmented reality and IoT (CoAP protocol), so there are some similar minor projects I've worked on to learn the basics.
